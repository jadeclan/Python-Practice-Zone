Exercise: set difference and dict difference
Consider the two dictionaries:
    dictA = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'd': 3}
    dictB = {'a': 0, 'c': 3, 'd': 3}
Use a set difference operation to identify the set of common keys.
Now reduce dictA to just these keys. Do it 2 different ways:
1   Using a loop
2   Using a dictionary comprehension
