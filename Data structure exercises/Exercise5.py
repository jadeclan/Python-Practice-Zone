Exercise: loop through a dictionary
Consider the following dictionary:
    work_shifts = {
        'Alice': 'Weekdays',
        'Bob': 'Weekdays',
        'Charly': 'Weekends',
        'Denise': 'Weekdays'
    }
Loop through the key-value pairs to populate two new lists: a list of people working weekends, and a list of people working weekdays.
Now try creating both lists using list comprehensions.
